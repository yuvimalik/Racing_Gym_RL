# Core dependencies
# Note: numpy 1.22.3 is not available for Python 3.11+, so we use compatible versions
# stable-baselines3 2.4.0+ supports gymnasium 0.29.1+ and numpy>=1.20,<2.0
# gymnasium 0.29.1+ requires numpy>=1.21.0
# racecar-gym may require numpy==1.22.3, but we'll install it with --no-deps first
# then install other packages, allowing pip to resolve conflicts
numpy>=1.23.0,<2.0
gymnasium>=0.29.1
stable-baselines3[extra]>=2.4.0
# pybullet - try to get pre-built wheel, if not available install build tools
# Alternative: install via conda: conda install -c conda-forge pybullet
pybullet>=3.2.0

# Racecar gym - install from GitHub
# Install without dependencies first, then let pip resolve
# If this fails, we may need to patch racecar-gym's setup.py
